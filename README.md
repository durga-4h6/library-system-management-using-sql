**Library Management System – SQL Project**
**Project Overview**
This project is a Library Management System designed using Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) concepts.
It demonstrates practical implementation of database design, SQL queries, joins, procedures, and triggers to manage library operations efficiently.

**Technologies Used**
SQL (MySQL)
RDBMS Concepts
Stored Procedures
Triggers
Joins & Subqueries
Database Structure

The database consists of the following key tables:
tbl_book – Stores book details
tbl_library_branch – Stores branch information
tbl_borrower – Stores borrower detail
tbl_book_loans – Tracks book borrowing activity
tbl_book_copies – Manages available book copies

Primary and foreign keys are used to maintain data integrity.
**Features**
Track books available in each library branch
Manage borrower records
Monitor book loans and due dates
Identify borrowers with no active loans
Analyze popular books and authors
Automated logging using SQL triggers

**Sample SQL Operations**

INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN
GROUP BY & HAVING
Stored Procedures
Triggers
Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM)

**Business Insights**
Certain library branches show higher loan activity
A small number of borrowers account for multiple loans
Popular authors show consistent demand

**How to Run the Project**
Import the .sql file into MySQL
Execute table creation scripts
Insert sample data
Run queries, procedures, and triggers
